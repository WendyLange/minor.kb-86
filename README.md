During the minor, each student followed their own learning path when making the assignments. 
Every five weeks we started with a new theme and a delivery. The intention was that the progress and the final results were well described. 
In addition, a reflection was written for each week in order to find out what you have learned each week and what you would possibly do differently. 

The minor consists of four blocks of five weeks each. During the first three weeks we worked on our learning curves. 
In the fourth block we were put in groups and then set up a joint website with the end result of each block.
