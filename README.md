# minor.kb-86
During the minor, each student followed their own learning path when making the assignments. 
Every five weeks we started with a new theme and a delivery. The intention was that the progress and the final results were well described. 
In addition, a reflection was written for each week in order to find out what you have learned each week and what you would possibly do differently. 

The minor consists of four blocks of five weeks each. During the first three weeks we worked on our learning curves. 
In the fourth block we were put in groups and then set up a joint website with the end result of each block.

Below are the links to the other groups who also participated in the minor. 
It was put in here, because it had not been taken into account that this had to be put in the website. 
To prevent a student from having a different version of the website, it has been resolved this way.
